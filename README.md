Horus is a Wear OS dedicated to flashlight modes, tested on Android Studio emulator API 33 and Samsung Galaxy Watch4.
Horus's purpose is to give users different flashlight modes with different colors and different shifting intervals between colors. 
It is a project made only for fun, but if you have any suggestions be it UI, to modify the app, to optimize it, or only to say this app is crap you are very welcome.
